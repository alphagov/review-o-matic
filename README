== Review-O-Matic notes:

To create a user for development run: 

	$ bundle exec rake db:setup
	$ bundle exec rake db:seed

To login to Review-O-Matic with this user, go to the path:

http://reviewomatic.dev.gov.uk/__/sign_in?access_token=password

To create actual users, copy a list of their emails to somewhere on the production box (e.g. /etc/reviewomatic/departmental_users.txt) and then run the rake task
	$ bundle exec rake db:create_users[/path/to/your/file/of/users]

In preview and production you need to prefix this with RAILS_ENV=production (NB. production for both).

This task creates users for the email addresses given if they do not already exist, then emails all users (whether created by script or already existing) with their login details.

Keep an eye on the rake task as when it has finished it will print out a list of ones that failed, e.g. invalid email addresses.
