    <p>Hello, thanks for taking the time to look through how redirection will work when <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> is live.</p>
    <p>This tool provides a side by side browser that lets you explore Directgov pages on the left hand side of the page and see how users will be directed to new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> content on the right hand side.</p>
    <p>The different outcomes that you can expect when exploring the redirections are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You see a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> page - as an existing page maps directly to new content on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a></li>
      <li>You see a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> awaiting content page - where we will be redirecting users to new content but that content's not created yet</li>
      <li>You see a gone page - where old content does not map to an identified user need</li>
      <li>You see a missing mapping page - there may be some occasions where a mapping doesn't exist, please flag these.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want to flag a mapping for review at GDS then you can use the "flag this mapping" button in the top right hand corner and enter a reason why this should be flagged.</p>
    <p>All comments will be collated by GDS and sent back to fact check coordinators on 10th August.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions on the tool then please email <a href="mailto:ashley.stephens@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">ashley.stephens@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>
